# Number-Guessing-Game-OOP
This is another number guessing game. I used OOP in Python. 11/7/21 10am
I've made this game many times now, just wanted to code something this morning and couldn't decide what.
Simple game, just guess a number in between 1 and 100. It will tell you higher or lower unill you get it. 
And will keep track of your score too.
